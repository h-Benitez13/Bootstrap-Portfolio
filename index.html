                                Born in Los Angeles, California. Home of the Dodgers, Lakers, tacos, and sunshine.
                                Despite being born in LA, growing up I moved alot do to my fathers work and other
                                things...
                                By the time I hit 8th grade, I attended 13 to 14 different schools.
                                Each school within a different city and state. Despite these changes I consider myself
                                a true LA kid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have 3 younger siblings who I consider my children. By the time I was 10, my parents
                                were gone and I was left with three younger siblings at my grandparents house.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Practically raising them until I had to focus on my personal achievements, my siblings
                                were (at times) still my everything.
                                Side tracking from family; I went to school in Syracuse, NY. Graduated with a B.A. in
                                Psychology, focusing on Interpersonal Relationships.
                            </p>

                        <div class="row">

                                    Now, I live in Center City, working in King Of Prussia! Forty minute commute, which
                                    isnt bad since I listen to music at a level that is considered "ear bursting".
                                    And that's pretty much it, I guess. In defining terms of personality I like pizza,
                                    music, movies and basketball.
